# `wallet_getCallsStatus`

Returns the status of a call batch that was sent via `wallet_sendCalls`. The `atomic` field indicates whether the wallet executed the calls atomically or not, which affects the structure of the `receipts` field.

## Example Usage

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_getCallsStatus',
  params: ['0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331']
})
// @log: {
// @log:   version: "1.0",
// @log:   chainId: "0x01",
// @log:   id: "0xe670ec64341771606e55d6b4ca35a1a6b75ee3d5145a99d05921026d1527331",
// @log:   status: 200,
// @log:   atomic: true,
// @log:   receipts: [
// @log:     {
// @log:       logs: [
// @log:         {
// @log:           address: '0xa922b54716264130634d6ff183747a8ead91a40b',
// @log:           topics: ['0x5a2a90727cc9d000dd060b1132a5c977c9702bb3a52afe360c9c22f0e9451a68'],
// @log:           data: '0xabcd'
// @log:         }
// @log:       ],
// @log:       status: '0x1',
// @log:       blockHash: '0xf19bbafd9fd0124ec110b848e8de4ab4f62bf60c189524e54213285e7f540d4a',
// @log:       blockNumber: '0xabcd',
// @log:       gasUsed: '0xdef',
// @log:       transactionHash: '0x9b7bb827c2e5e3c1a0a44dc53e573aa0b3af3bd1f9f5ed03071b100bb039eaff'
// @log:     }
// @log:   ]
// @log: }

## Parameters

* `[string]` 

An array with a single element: a call bundle identifier returned by a `wallet_sendCalls` call.

## Returns

* ### version
  * `string`
  * The version of the API being used. Currently "1.0".

* ### chainId
  * `string`
  * The chain ID in hexadecimal format.

* ### id
  * `string`
  * The call bundle identifier.

* ### status
  * `number`
  * Status code indicating the current state of the batch. Status codes follow these categories:
    * 1xx: Pending states
      * 100: Batch has been received by the wallet but has not completed execution onchain
    * 2xx: Confirmed states
      * 200: Batch has been included onchain without reverts
    * 4xx: Offchain failures
      * 400: Batch has not been included onchain and wallet will not retry
    * 5xx: Chain rules failures
      * 500: Batch reverted completely and only changes related to gas charge may have been included onchain
    * 6xx: Partial chain rules failures
      * 600: Batch reverted partially and some changes related to batch calls may have been included onchain

* ### atomic
  * `boolean`
  * Indicates whether the wallet executed the calls atomically or not. If `true`, the wallet executed all calls in a single transaction. If `false`, the wallet executed the calls in multiple transactions.

* ### receipts
  * `Receipt[]`
  * The receipts associated with a call bundle, if available. The structure depends on the `atomic` field:
    * If `atomic` is `true`, this may be a single receipt or an array of receipts, corresponding to how the batch was included onchain
    * If `atomic` is `false`, this must be an array of receipts for all transactions containing batch calls that were included onchain
  * Each receipt contains:
    * logs
      * `Log[]`
      * The logs generated by the calls. For smart contract wallets (e.g. ERC-4337), these should only include logs relevant to the specific calls, not infrastructure logs.
    * status
      * `'0x1' | '0x0'`
      * `0x1` for success, `0x0` for failure
    * blockHash
      * `Hash`
      * Hash of the block containing these calls
    * blockNumber
      * `Hex`
      * Block number containing these calls
    * gasUsed
      * `Hex`
      * The amount of gas used by these calls
    * transactionHash
      * `Hash`
      * Hash of the transaction containing these calls

* ### capabilities
  * `Record<string, any>`
  * Optional capability-specific metadata
