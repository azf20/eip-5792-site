# Future development

There is significant work ahead to establish broad adoption of EIP-5792, however there is already work taking place to build on this EIP.

- [ERC-7677](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7677) defines the Paymaster capability.
- [ERC-7715](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7715) adds a JSON-RPC method for granting permissions from a wallet, which depends on EIP-5792.
- There is an open PR for [ERC-7865](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9259), which allows dapps to downgrade their required atomicity guarantees and control the behaviour after a failed/reverted call
- There is an open PR for [ERC-7836](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/758), which will build on this EIP to better support session keys.
