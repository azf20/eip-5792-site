# `atomic` Capability

The `atomic` capability specifies how a wallet will execute batches of transactions requested through the `wallet_sendCalls` method. This capability is expressed separately for each chain and should be interpreted as a guarantee only for batches of transactions on that chain.

## Specification

### Wallet

The `atomic` capability has a `status` field that can take one of three values:

* `supported`: The wallet will execute all calls atomically and contiguously
* `ready`: The wallet is able to upgrade to `supported` pending user approval (e.g. via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702))
* `unsupported`: The wallet does not provide any atomicity or contiguity guarantees

If the `atomic` capability is not present for a given chain, it means that the wallet does not support batching for that chain.

#### Example

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_getCapabilities',
  params: ['0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567']
})
// @log: {
// @log:   "0x2105": {
// @log:     "atomic": {
// @log:       "status": "supported"
// @log:     }
// @log:   },
// @log:   "0x14A34": {
// @log:     "atomic": {
// @log:       "status": "unsupported"
// @log:     }
// @log:   }
// @log: }
```

### App

When sending a batch of calls using `wallet_sendCalls`, apps can specify their atomicity requirements using the `atomicRequired` field:

* If `atomicRequired` is set to `true`:
  * The wallet MUST execute all calls atomically and contiguously
  * The wallet MUST reject the request if it cannot guarantee atomic execution
  * If the wallet's `atomic` capability is `ready`, it MUST upgrade to `supported` before proceeding
* If `atomicRequired` is set to `false`:
  * The wallet MUST execute calls sequentially (one after another)
  * The calls need not be contiguous (other transactions may be interleaved)
  * Some calls may fail independently
  * The wallet MAY still execute the batch atomically if it supports it

Apps should check the wallet's capabilities using `wallet_getCapabilities` before sending requests with `atomicRequired: true` to ensure the wallet supports atomic execution on the target chain.

### Relationship with EIP-7702

The `ready` status is particularly relevant for wallets that can upgrade to support atomic execution through [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702). When a wallet indicates `status: "ready"`, it means:

1. The account is an EOA (Externally Owned Account)
2. It can upgrade to a smart account that supports atomic execution via an EIP-7702 delegation
3. The upgrade requires user approval
4. Once upgraded, the wallet will support atomic execution of batches for that EOA

This allows apps to request atomic execution even from EOAs, as long as the wallet is capable of upgrading to support it.
